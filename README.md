# üë∑ PropertyLoop Agent

## :pushpin: Project Overview

**PropertyLoop-Agent** is a Streamlit-based multi-agent chatbot designed to resolve Real Estate‚Äìrelated queries using multimodal inputs. Users can upload property images and enter text queries (e.g., questions about property issues or tenancy FAQs), and the system intelligently routes the request to the correct agent. The project leverages LangChain for agent orchestration with a Groq-backed Llama 3.2 vision model and an external SerpAPI tool (integrated via LangChain) for Web Search to enrich its responses.

Key components of the project include:
- **Image Upload & Caching:** Uploaded images are encoded and stored in Streamlit's session state, preventing redundant Base64 re-encoding across multiple queries.
- **Agent Switching:** A routing logic determines which agent to use based on image presence and text keywords.
- **Multimodal Analysis:** The property issue troubleshooting agent uses image analysis (via a placeholder vision function) combined with text context to diagnose issues like water damage, cracks, or mold.
- **Tenancy FAQ Agent:** This agent handles tenancy-related questions by leveraging external context sourced from SerpAPI.

## :scroll: How It Works

### User Upload & Encoded:

- The user uploads an image using the Streamlit file uploader.
- The app encodes the image to Base64 and pass it to the Multimodal Vision + Text for Analysis.

### Agent Routing (Router Mechanism):

- A helper function (classify_input) examines the presence of an image and keywords in the text query.
- If an image is present, the query is routed to the Property Issue Troubleshooting Agent (Agent1).
- If the text query contains tenancy-specific keywords, it is routed to the Tenancy FAQ Agent (Agent2).

### Response Generation:

- The property agent integrates a simulated image analysis and text query to generate a detailed diagnosis and solution of it.
- The tenancy agent takes text query and provide expert tenancy law guidance.
- Both Agent uses Langchain implemented SerpAPI Web Search tool to get Information from Internet for additional context

## :question: FAQ

Q. Which tools/tech were used?

Ans. The project uses LangChain for agent management and tool binding, the Groq-backed Llama 3.2 vision model for multimodal processing, and SerpAPI (via Google Search as configured) for external context.

Q. What is the logic behind agent switching?

Ans. Here, Router Mechanism is used for Agent Selection. The logic checks if an image is provided or if the text query contains tenancy-related keywords. Based on that, it routes the query to either the property troubleshooting agent (when an image exists) or the tenancy FAQ agent.

Q. How does image-based issue detection work?

Ans. The image is encoded with Base64 Encoder and passed Image + Text to Groq Llama 3.2 Vision Model along with prompts and extracts information about potential issues (e.g., water damage, cracks etc..) and provide solution of it.
